    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the REA App accesses and uses your Google account data.</p>

    <h2>Data Access and Usage</h2>
    <p>The REA App accesses your Google Drive files only to perform the following three specific functions:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Provide you with a list of users who have access to the files that you own or can access.</li>
        <li>Allow you to search and see which files a specific user has access to within your files.</li>
        <li>Allow you to remove access permissions for specific users from your files if needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Beyond these three functions, the app performs no additional operations on your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Sharing</h2>
    <p>The REA App does <strong>not</strong> store your data or any metadata about your files or users. It does <strong>not</strong> send any data to the app developer or any third party. All processing is done in real time through your session and stays within your Google account environment.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>The REA App only uses the permissions required to perform the described functions above and does not request or use unnecessary permissions.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
